a single server infrastructure with a LAMP stack can be a simple and cost-effective solution for small websites with low traffic, yet it has limitations in terms of:

• Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
This infrastructure relies on one server for everything. If the server goes down due to hardware failure, power outage, or software issues, the entire website becomes inaccessible (downtime). This makes it a SPOF, meaning a single point of failure can bring everything down.

• Maintenance Downtime:
Performing essential maintenance, like updates or bug fixes, often requires restarting the web server software. This, unfortunately, also means the website becomes temporarily unavailable during this time.

• Scalability:
This setup struggles with scaling up to handle increasing traffic. As the website grows in popularity and receives more visitors, the single server might not be able to handle the load, leading to slow performance or crashes.
